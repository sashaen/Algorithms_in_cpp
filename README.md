Algorithms in cpp from very start.
1. Tower of Hanoi
  It is a mathematical puzzel, having 3 rods( source, auxiliary,destination), and n no of disks. Its main work is to shift all discs from source to destination one by one           following these 3 rules strictly :-
  a) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
  b) Only that disk can be moved, which will be the uppermost in any rod.
  c) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
